        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p class="lead">The evaluation tool is based on the assumption that the texts in each group have something in common. We call this a unifying feature. Unifying features are often Themes (e.g., Football, Politics, Natural Disasters, a person, a city), or Events (e.g., a particular football match, an election, a hurricane). Sometimes, the unifying feature is something else (e.g., opinions, formality) which are more difficult to identify but may still give insight into the AI models.</p>
      
        <p class="lead">Your task is to explore the group and assess if any unifying feature exists. The models may have made mistakes when grouping the texts. If so, you should remove some texts from the group and define the feature from the remaining texts. You will be given the opportunity to explain why some texts are removed.</p>
      
        <h4 class="mt-5">Explore the Group:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Read all the titles carefully.</li>
          <li>Click on the title to show the text body of an article if you are unsure what it is about.</li>
          <li>Make up your mind what is most unifying for these articles.</li>
          <li>Exclude articles that don't fit with the rest of the group.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>Unifying Feature:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Select one of the following unifying feature types:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event:</strong> Something placed in time (e.g., a particular football match, an election, a hurricane).</li>
                <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Not bound by time (e.g., Football, Politics, Natural Disasters, a person, a city).</li>
                <li><strong>Other:</strong> Something unites the articles but is not an Event or a Theme (e.g., language style, opinion, formality).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>Name the group.</li>
            <li>Optionally write a comment about why you are excluding some articles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Rate the complexity of the task:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You are asked to rate your agreement to statements about your experience assessing the group.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4 class="mt-5">Important Note:</h4>
